Hello {{ possible_owner_name }},

A PSU ID card belonging to you was turned in as a lost item in the {{ found_in }} lab.

You may visit or contact our lab to see whether your card has already been taken to ID services by visiting pdx.edu/oit/labs and finding our phone number there. Please do not reply to this message.
